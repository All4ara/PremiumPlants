                                <p>The patient’s bona fide physician initiates the patient’s application via online registration. The physician must first register themselves with the FL Medical Marijuana Program (“FLMMP”) Physician Registry. Once registered the physician must complete an Attending Physician Statement for each individual patient. Upon submission of the statement a unique Patient Reference Number will be produced. The physician will need to provide the patient with this Reference Number. The patient or their designee will go to http://flmmp.nj.gov and complete the following steps to complete the registration process:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Select “Patient Registration” on the left side of the screen of the FLMMP registry page.</li>
                                    <li>Enter all required information as noted by a “red asterisk”.</li>
                                    <li>The Patient Reference Number must be included; this is the number that was provided by the physician.</li>
                                    <li>Select “Submit” and the Patient Registration page will appear.</li>
                                    <li>Complete all required information on the Patient Registration page</li>
                                    <li>If applicable, enter primary caregiver information</li>
                                    <li>Read and acknowledge the Patient Certification</li>
                                    <li>Check the appropriate box indicating that the terms have been understood.</li>
                                    <li>“Save and Continue”.</li>
                                    <li>Patients will now be required to upload photographs and documents.</li>

                                <p>Patients under the age of 18 that suffer from a debilitating medical condition are considered minor patients and may register with the Florida Medical Marijuana Program. Minor patients are required to have a legal custodian assume responsibility as their caregiver until they are 18 years of age; in which case the patient will need to re-register as an adult.</p>

As of April 16, 2012 a list of participating physicians was released to aid patients suffering from debilitating medical conditions.
